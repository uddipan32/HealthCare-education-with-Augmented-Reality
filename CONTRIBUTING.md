# Contributor Guidelines

After creating a fork of the current repository, you are all set to contribute towards the development of this app.

To build your project, run these 3 commands in the command line **(bash/fish/git bash)**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/learn_ar_flutter.git
cd learn_ar_flutter/
flutter run
```

These commands will clone your forked repository, navigate into the project directory, and execute a Flutter build command, respectively.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure to have Flutter installed and in your path. Refer to [this](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) link to get help getting started.

* Also, make sure to have your mobile device connected / an emulator up and running before executing the build command.

* As this project uses the *Sceneform SDK*, it is also important to have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed to be able to add 3D models to the app. *However, if you do not want to add any 3D models, you can simply skip this step*.

## Making commits

Make sure to have your commits in a separate branch from master. To switch to a new git branch, type:
```bash
git checkout -b [BRANCH NAME]
```

## Making a Pull Request

* Add relevant images / screenshots of the output of your work, if possible.

* If your PR solves an issue, make sure to write `Fixes #[ISSUE NUMBER]` in the description.

* If your PR partially solves an issue / is a part of some issue, make sure to write `Part of #[ISSUE NUMBER]` in the description.

* In case you are adding a feature of which an issue doesn't yet exist, make sure to open a [new issue](https://github.com/akshansh2000/learn_ar_flutter/issues/new) regarding the same before proceeding.

## Opening Issues

There are no specific rules for opening issues, however, add relevant images/screenshots of the issue, if possible.
